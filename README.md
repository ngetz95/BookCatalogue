# BookCatalogue

This program is intended to help any avid reader keep track of the books in their personal library. It is still early in development, and at this time the main functionality is still not implemented.

The end product will provide a simple yet effective way of personal library management. It will provide a GUI which will display all of the books you enter, and will provide many sorting options including ISBN, name, author, and owner. A full list of possibilities will be explained here at a later date when full functionality has been achieved.
