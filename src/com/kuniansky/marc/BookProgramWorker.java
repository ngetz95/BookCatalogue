 * December 1, 2015		Marc Kuniansky		Implemented the constructor with no parameters
 * 
 * Future stuff:
 * This hasn't actually been implemented yet. This class should be the one which makes everything work.
 * Think of this like the main method- lots of progressive steps which make the program run. 
 * After we get the basic functionality set up, we should refactor this into the GUI and have the GUI handle most
 * everything, I think. I could be wrong, though.
