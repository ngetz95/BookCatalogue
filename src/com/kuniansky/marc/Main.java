 * December 1, 2015		Marc Kuniansky		Implemented the main method, which calls on a BookProgramWorker class to
 * 											run all other aspects of the program. I like to keep main methods simple, 
 * 											so having it run as few lines of code as possible is ideal for me.
 * 
 * Future notes:
 * This doesn't really ever need to be changed much, until we deal with a GUI. I don't entirely know how we
 * will handle that when the time comes.
 * 
 * I REALLY prefer keeping the main method as clean as possible, so let's try not to touch this much until we have to.
